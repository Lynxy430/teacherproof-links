to get started with this you first of all need the shortcuts, a focus mode named,  Teacherproof

you will then need to click automations and create one and choose App

make sure it says run immediately and choose the EDUCATIONAL apps and make sure it is still on the option when opened

now find the High Brightness shortcut and click on it. This will make it so when you open the app, the screen goes to max brightness

make another automation and choose app making sure it is run immediately and when opened however now choose the games or browser. on the next page click the Low Brightness shortcut and that is the second automation done.

for the third automation you are going to click the Teacherproof focus option and click when turning on and run immediately. Now pick the AssistiveTouch On shortcut

before you make the next automation you want to go into settings, Accessibility, Touch, AssistiveTouch and make the long press the lock screen.

for the single tap you will go back to the shortcuts app and make a shortcut and add the Open App action and choose any EDUCATIONAL app (this is so when you click it, it takes you straight to the app) and name it whatever you want

now to back to settings and for single tap you will choose the shortcut you just made (you can make more of these Open App Shortcuts and switch depending on what app you need to use in AssistiveTouch eg. Sora and PowerPoint)

For the fourth automation you will choose Teacherproof but you will choose when turning off and run immediately. Now choose the AssistiveTouch Off shortcut cause you dont need it when not using the mode

And as far as that it should be good
